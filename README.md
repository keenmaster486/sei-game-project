<h1>Overview</h1>

This is a very basic scrolling 2D platformer game.<br>

The user controls the player with the arrow keys, CTRL, and the spacebar.<br>

Arrow keys ------- Move around (left, right, look up, look down)<br>
CTRL ------------- Jump<br>
Spacebar --------- Fire raygun<br>

You play as Glorp, an extraterrestrial being from the Planet Bloog who has been tasked with colonizing Earth's Moon.<br>
Unfortunately, the guys over at Planet Fleeb had the same idea. Using your trusty Stun-o-Matic 50XR raygun,<br>
you will fight off those Fleebian baddies and claim the Moon for Planet Bloog.<br>

Here are the items you can collect and their point values:<br>

Moon rock ------------------------- 100<br>
Coca-Cola (imported) -------------- 200<br>
Newspaper ------------------------- 500<br>
Space Junk ------------------------ 750<br>
